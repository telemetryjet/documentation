The CLI binaries are also available as static files for manual installation. Using this method, you are responsible for downloading the archive and adding the root folder to the path.

### Download an Archive

Archives are available for each release and platform on the [TelemetryJet Download Server](https://downloads.telemetryjet.com/builds/cli/). Download and extract the archive for your platform and architecture.

The static archive contains a single subfolder. Copy the contents of this folder into an installation directory. Suggested default directories for each platform:
- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\TelemetryJet CLI`
- **Linux/MacOS**: `/var/telemetryjet-cli`

### Add to System Path

Add the `bin` subfolder inside the installation directory to your `PATH` environment variable, for example:
- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\TelemetryJet CLI\bin`
- **Linux/MacOS**: `/var/telemetryjet-cli/bin`

Once the folder is on the path, the TelemetryJet CLI utility, `jet`, is available in a shell anywhere.

### Test Installation

To test the installation, run `jet --version` from your shell. This should output the version of the CLI you have installed, for example: 
<pre>
TelemetryJet CLI (version 0.0.1, platform Linux-5.4.0-52-generic, architecture x86_64)
</pre>

### Updating
To update a manual installation, download the new version and overwrite the folder containing the old version. Your configuration data will be preserved.
