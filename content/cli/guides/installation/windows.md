## Recommended Installation

The recommended installation method on Windows is to download the latest installer from the [TelemetryJet Download Server](https://downloads.telemetryjet.com/builds/cli/windows). The installer will set up everything required to run the TelemetryJet CLI.

### Installing
Download and extract the latest Windows installer from the [TelemetryJet Download Server](https://downloads.telemetryjet.com/builds/cli/windows/). Installer files end in `.exe` on the download server.

Run the installer, which will guide you through the process of installing the TelemetryJet CLI. The installer will ask for an installation directory, which will hold the TelemetryJet CLI and your data. Most users should choose the default directory.

### Upgrading
To upgrade the CLI, download and run the latest installer and select the same installation directory as your previous installation. The installer will update the CLI to the latest version.

### Uninstalling
To uninstall, find and remove `TelemetryJet CLI` through the Windows Control Panel, or search "Uninstall TelemetryJet CLI" in the start menu. The uninstaller will remove all configuration and data from your computer.

## Manual Installation
The TelemetryJet CLI can also be manually installed on Windows. See [Manual Installation](/cli/guides/installation/manual_install/) for detailed instructions on how to manually install the CLI.
