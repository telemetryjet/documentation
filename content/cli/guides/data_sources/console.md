## Overview
`console` writes to standard output in the command line. Any data points this data source receives will be displayed in the console.

When combined with the `--silent` flag, which silences all debug and error messages, you can use this to pipe output from Jet into any command-line program.

## I/O Format
For each data point this data source receives, it will print text to the console in the format `key=value` followed by a newline.  This data source does not produce any data points.
